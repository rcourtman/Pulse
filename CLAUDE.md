# Claude Development Notes

## Git Workflow and Automated Releases

### ü§ñ Ultra-Simple Release Philosophy

**Key Principle**: Linear flow with auto-merging. Your workflow:
1. Work on `develop` branch (push freely, no releases)
2. Create PR to `main` when ready to test with users ‚Üí RC created + auto-merged
3. Manually trigger stable release when happy with main

**What happens automatically**:
- PR from develop‚Üímain creates RC and merges immediately
- No lingering PRs, no conflicts
- `main` always has your latest tested code
- Version numbers handled by workflows

**What requires manual action**:
- Creating PR (when you want an RC)
- Triggering stable release (when RC is tested)

### Release Workflow Overview

1. **Development Phase (develop branch):**
   - Push commits freely all day
   - NO automatic releases
   - Work normally without noise

2. **RC Testing Phase (PR to main):**
   - `gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "Release: feature X"`
   - RC automatically created (e.g., v3.29.0-rc1)
   - PR automatically merged to main
   - Test RC with users
   - Need changes? Push to develop, create new PR ‚Üí new RC

3. **Stable Release Phase (manual):**
   - When happy with testing
   - Actions ‚Üí "Manual Stable Release" ‚Üí Run
   - Creates stable from current main
   - Updates Docker :latest tag

### üåø Branch Strategy - When to Stay vs. Switch

**Default: Always work on `develop`**
- Make all code changes on develop
- Push to develop (no automatic releases)
- Check release status from develop (don't switch just to view)

**Only switch branches when:**
1. **Resolving PR merge conflicts**: `gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>`
2. **Fixing critical issues on main**: `git checkout main` (rare)
3. **User explicitly requests working on a different branch**

**Never switch branches to:**
- View releases (`gh release list` works from any branch)
- Check workflow status (`gh run list` works from any branch)  
- "Clean up" git state (usually unnecessary)

**After switching branches, always return to develop:**
```bash
git checkout develop
```

### Release Process (Dead Simple!)

**Creating RC Release:**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: First check ALL commits that will be included in the PR
git log --oneline main..develop

# When ready to test with users:
gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "Release: Your feature"

# That's it! The workflow will:
# 1. Create RC release (e.g., v3.29.0-rc1)
# 2. Auto-merge PR to main
# 3. No manual merge needed!
```

**CRITICAL: Creating Comprehensive PR Descriptions**
When creating a PR, you MUST:
1. **Always run `git log --oneline main..develop`** to see ALL commits that will be included
2. **Include ALL features and fixes** in the PR title and description, not just the latest change
3. **Group changes by category**: Major Features, Bug Fixes, Technical Changes, etc.
4. **Reference relevant issue numbers** (e.g., #125) for each fix or feature

Example of a good PR title:
- ‚úÖ "Release: PBS namespace support, port handling fix, and UI improvements"
- ‚ùå "Release: Fix port handling" (when there are actually multiple changes)

**Creating Stable Release:**
```bash
# After RC testing is complete:

# Option 1: Via GitHub UI
# Actions ‚Üí "Manual Stable Release" ‚Üí Run workflow ‚Üí Run

# Option 2: Via CLI
gh workflow run stable-release.yml --ref main
```

**That's the entire process!** No complex merge strategies, no lingering PRs, no conflicts.

### Version Management

**Automatic Version Handling:**
- RC workflow analyzes commits and determines next version
- Stable workflow increments from current stable version
- No manual version management needed
- Workflows handle all version bumps automatically

### üîÑ Update System Architecture

**Components Overview:**
- **Installer script**: Auto-included in all release tarballs (`scripts/install-pulse.sh`)
- **UI updates**: Available through Settings > Software Updates  
- **Docker**: Automatic builds for both stable (`:latest`) and RC (`:rc`) channels
- **Version checking**: Footer checks for updates using user's configured channel

**Key Update Features:**
- **Channel persistence**: User's channel preference (stable/RC) persists across updates
- **Auto-refresh**: UI automatically refreshes 8 seconds after update restart
- **Channel-specific checking**: Stable users only see stable updates, RC users only see RC updates

**Update Flow:**
1. User clicks "Apply Update" in Settings
2. System downloads and installs new version
3. Service restarts automatically  
4. Frontend auto-refreshes after 8-second delay
5. User remains on their selected channel (stable/RC)

**Related Files:**
- `src/public/js/ui/settings.js` - Update UI and channel persistence
- `src/public/js/main.js` - Footer version checking
- `server/routes/api.js` - Version API endpoints
- `scripts/install-pulse.sh` - Installation and update logic

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=rc-release.yml --limit=3

# View latest releases
gh release list --limit=5

# Test installer (includes API rate limit fallback)
./install-pulse.sh --version v3.25.5-rc2
```

### üîß Common Issues and Recovery Patterns

#### RC Workflow Issues
```bash
# If RC creation fails, check:
gh run list --workflow=rc-release.yml --limit=3

# RC should auto-merge, but if stuck:
# Just create a new PR - it will handle everything
```

#### Workflow Failures
```bash
# Check workflow status first:
gh run list --workflow=<workflow-name> --limit=3

# If workflow failed due to conflicts, it usually retries automatically
# Wait 5-10 minutes before manual intervention

# For persistent failures, check workflow logs:
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

#### Missing Files in Releases
- RC releases: Check if CSS build step exists in workflow
- Stable releases: Check if all necessary files are copied to staging directory
- Both: Verify workflow has proper Node.js setup before building

#### Version Number Issues
- RC and stable workflows use version analysis logic
- Don't manually fix version numbers - fix the workflow logic instead
- Check versionUtils.js for version determination logic

### Manual Stable Release Process

After your PR is merged to main and RC testing is complete:

1. **Via GitHub UI (recommended):**
   - Go to the repository's Actions tab
   - Find "Manual Stable Release" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select `main` branch
   - (Optional) Specify version or leave blank for auto-detection
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. **Via GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Run with auto-determined version
   gh workflow run stable-release.yml --ref main
   
   # Run with specific version
   gh workflow run stable-release.yml --ref main -f version=3.29.0
   ```

The workflow will:
- Use current main branch state (already has your RC changes)
- Create the stable release with proper changelog
- Build and push Docker images with :latest tag

### üö® CRITICAL: Keep It Simple (Anti-Pattern Warnings)

**The Golden Rule**: Trust the automation, make minimal changes, stay on `develop`.

**‚ùå NEVER do these:**
- Switch branches unnecessarily (stay on `develop` unless resolving PR conflicts)
- Manually manage version numbers (workflows handle this automatically)
- Fight with git when workflows are running fine (they have retry logic)
- Run complex git operations when simple ones work
- Check out `main` just to view releases (use `gh release view` from any branch)
- Try to "fix" things that are already working correctly

**‚úÖ ALWAYS do this simple workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Work on develop (stay here!)
git checkout develop

# 2. Make your changes and test them
npm run test          # or whatever test command exists

# 3. Commit and push (NO releases)
git add .
git commit -m "description of change"
git push origin develop

# 4. When ready to test with users, check commits and create PR
git log --oneline main..develop  # CHECK ALL COMMITS FIRST!
gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "Release: feature X"
# RC created and PR auto-merged!

# 5. Test the RC with users
# If issues: fix in develop, create new PR for new RC

# 6. When happy, trigger stable release
gh workflow run stable-release.yml --ref main
# Or use GitHub UI: Actions ‚Üí Manual Stable Release ‚Üí Run
```

**Remember**: If something seems complex, it's probably wrong. The workflows handle complexity - you handle simplicity.

## Summary of Ultra-Simple Workflow

**Three simple steps:**
1. üî® **Develop**: Push to develop freely (no releases)
2. üß™ **Test**: Create PR ‚Üí RC + auto-merge
3. üöÄ **Release**: Manual trigger ‚Üí stable release

**No more:**
- ‚ùå Multiple open PRs
- ‚ùå Merge conflicts
- ‚ùå Manual PR merging
- ‚ùå Complex version management
- ‚ùå Excessive RC releases

**Just:**
- ‚úÖ Linear progression
- ‚úÖ Auto-merging PRs
- ‚úÖ Clean release flow

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
