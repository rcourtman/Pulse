# Upcoming Release Highlights

## Improvements

- Host agent installs now report back to Pulse in real time. The **Settings → Agents → Host agents** view surfaces the lookup status, highlights the matching row, and refreshes the connection badge without reloading.
- Host agents participate in the alert system alongside Proxmox and Docker sources. Offline detection, thresholds, and overrides live in **Settings → Alerts** and flow through the existing notification channels.

## Documentation

- Updated the host agent guide with the new lookup workflow, token-free commands, and alert integration notes.

_(Replace this stub with per-version notes when tagging the release.)_
