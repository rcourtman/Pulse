# Patrol and Assistant customer journey qualification

The customer job is: "Tell me what needs my attention, explain why, and help me
deal with it without creating more work." Patrol owns the issue and investigation.
Assistant explains that same issue and uses existing governed action contracts.

## Implemented interaction

`Explain with Assistant` on an attention item or active alert starts an explicit
explanation using the selected evidence. Opening the drawer without choosing a
task remains context only. The request preserves the composer draft and current
conversation, uses normal send/queue/retry handling, and does not enable autonomy.
Pending initialization is cancelled when the organisation changes or the drawer
component is disposed.

Attention handoffs use the canonical finding builder when exactly one finding
is linked. Otherwise they pass bounded attention evidence and typed resource and
action references without inventing a finding identity. Server-refreshed findings,
permissions, approval records, and execution policy remain authoritative.

The drawer names the selected issue, hides unrelated workflow starters while
context is attached, and explains that discovery adds service detail. Discovery
being off does not mean inventory, metrics, and alerts are unavailable.

## Browser interaction matrix

Run against the current authenticated local development build:

```sh
node scripts/check-patrol-assistant-journey.mjs
```

The script uses synthetic attention evidence and model responses, with other
non-GET application requests blocked. It writes screenshots and a result receipt
under `tmp/patrol-assistant-journey/`. It neither qualifies model reasoning nor
executes infrastructure actions. Authentication stays in browser memory.

| Surface | States and interactions |
|---|---|
| `/patrol`, 1440, 900 and 390 pixels wide | Start review, expand evidence, focus and activate Explain with Enter, inspect issue title and response, verify selected evidence/resource and one request |
| Assistant drawer | Draft preserved across close/reopen, no inference on ordinary open, no competing workflow starters, normal failed-request display and retry, reload without resubmission |
| `/alerts`, desktop and narrow | Open secondary action menu, dismiss with Escape and outside click, reopen, choose explanation, verify selected alert context and no Patrol trigger |
| Initialization regression tests | Newer context cannot be cleared by an earlier send, rejected send retains context, preparation failure reports error, organisation switch cancels old evidence |

Inspect screenshots for clipping, wrapping, readable responses, reachable input,
menu placement, and visible error/retry controls. The browser verification receipt
binds the pass to exact source hashes. Rerun affected states after source edits.

## Real outcome qualification still required

A scripted response passing the interaction matrix is not evidence that the
features deliver repeatable customer value. Qualify the following jobs on a
disposable environment with known ground truth before expanding claims or autonomy.

| Job | Useful result | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| Unhealthy service | Current evidence identifies the failed service and likely cause, then gives a supported next step | Healthy service, intentional stop, missing access, correlated dependency failure |
| Backup or capacity risk | Explains actual coverage or growth risk, what is uncertain, and a concrete next step | Healthy protection, stale evidence, unavailable backup source, capacity with no safe automatic fix |
| Supported VM/LXC change | Correct canonical targets, reviewable plan, approval before execution, independent result verification attached to the original issue | Rejected approval, unsupported operation, stale target, partial failure |

Use the existing `cmd/patrol-qualify` scenario runner and
`tests/qualification/patrol/scenarios/`, with explicit live-fault and remediation
authority for the disposable lab. Validate the catalog with:

```sh
go run ./cmd/patrol-qualify -mode validate
```

The existing Docker watch/investigation/remediation catalog provides service
cases. Backup/capacity cases and the complete VM/LXC customer journey need separate
ground-truth fixtures. The existing `ProxmoxBulkLifecycleActionScenario` checks
canonical planning but does not by itself prove execution and verification.

Record source SHA, runtime version, exact provider/model, effective permissions,
scenario ground truth, observed evidence, proposed action, approval and result,
useful/incorrect/missed diagnosis, latency and tokens/cost. A correct evidenced
"no action needed" or manual hardware replacement is a useful outcome. A tool
call or an action plan alone is not.

Compare model configurations on the same cases. Establish repeatability across
independent volunteered Pro environments before treating one successful install
as a product-wide result. Keep customer content out of default telemetry.

## Measurement boundaries

Use eligible paid cohorts and latest valid installation reports. Keep current
enablement separate from historical rolling usage. Do not divide findings by
investigations or actions when their retention and provenance differ. Do not
interpret Assistant/Patrol activity cooccurrence as a linked completed task.

Provider, cost and outcome telemetry requires schema adoption before it can be
used for assessment. Link outcomes locally to canonical findings/actions, export
only content-free aggregates, and distinguish useful diagnosis, justified no-op,
blocked access, rejected action, executed action and verified resolution.

The owning governance gap is `patrol-assistant-customer-outcome-qualification`.
This interaction repair does not close that gap or authorize release publication.
