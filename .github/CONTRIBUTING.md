# Contributing to Proxmox Helper Scripts

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Proxmox Helper Scripts. 

- Pull requests submitted against [**main**](https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/tree/main) are meticulously scrutinized, so please do not take it personally if I reject your request. If you follow the patterns that have been established throughout the codebase, you greatly increase the likelihood that your changes will get merged into [**main**](https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/tree/main).

- While it is true that the decision to accept or decline a pull request ultimately rests with the project maintainer, it is important to stress that complaining about the decision after it has been made is not productive behavior for the pull request submitter. It is crucial for all contributors to show respect for the decision-making process and collaborate effectively towards achieving the best possible outcome for the project.
