## 🚀 Overview

Pulse is a modern, unified dashboard for monitoring your **infrastructure** across Proxmox, Docker, Kubernetes, and TrueNAS. It consolidates metrics, alerts, and AI-powered insights from all your systems into a single, beautiful interface.

Designed for homelabs, sysadmins, and MSPs who need a "single pane of glass" without the complexity of enterprise monitoring stacks.

## 🧭 Unified Navigation

Pulse now groups everything by task instead of data source:
- **Infrastructure** for hosts and nodes
- **Workloads** for VMs, containers, and Kubernetes pods
- **Storage** and **Backups** as top-level views
- PMG now routes into **Infrastructure** (source filter), and Kubernetes routes into **Workloads** (K8s filter)
- Legacy URLs are no longer routed as compatibility aliases; use canonical v6 routes.

Power-user shortcuts:
- `g i` → Infrastructure, `g w` → Workloads, `?` → shortcuts help
- `/` or `Cmd/Ctrl+K` → global search

## ✨ Features

### Core Monitoring
- **Unified Monitoring**: View health and metrics for PVE, PBS, PMG, Docker, Kubernetes, and TrueNAS in one place
- **Smart Alerts**: Get notified via Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email, and more
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds Proxmox nodes on your network
- **Metrics History**: Persistent storage with configurable retention
- **Recovery Central**: Unified backup/snapshot/replication timeline across PBS and TrueNAS

### AI-Powered
- **Chat Assistant (BYOK)**: Ask questions about your infrastructure in natural language
- **Patrol (BYOK)**: Background health checks that generate findings on a schedule
- **Alert Analysis (Pro/Cloud)**: Optional AI analysis when alerts fire
- **Cost Tracking**: Track usage and costs per provider/model

### Multi-Platform
- **Proxmox VE/PBS/PMG**: Full monitoring and management
- **TrueNAS**: Pools, datasets, disks, ZFS snapshots, replication tasks, and alerts
- **Kubernetes**: Complete K8s cluster monitoring via agents
- **Docker/Podman**: Container and Swarm service monitoring
- **OCI Containers**: Proxmox 9.1+ native container support

### Security & Operations
- **Secure by Design**: Credentials encrypted at rest, strict API scoping, agent commands disabled by default
- **One-Click Updates**: Easy upgrades for supported deployments
- **OIDC/SSO/SAML**: Single sign-on with multi-provider support
- **Mobile Remote Access (Coming Soon)**: Relay protocol with end-to-end encryption is available now; public mobile app launch is in staged rollout (Pro)
- **Privacy Focused**: Anonymous telemetry is enabled by default and [fully documented](docs/PRIVACY.md) — no hostnames, credentials, or personal data is ever sent. Disable any time in Settings or via `PULSE_TELEMETRY=false`.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Option 1: Proxmox LXC (Recommended)
Run this one-liner on your Proxmox host to create a lightweight LXC container:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rcourtman/Pulse/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

Note: this installs the Pulse **server**. Agent installs use the command generated in **Settings → Unified Agents → Installation commands** (served from `/install.sh` on your Pulse server).

### Option 2: Docker
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pulse \
  -p 7655:7655 \
  -v pulse_data:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  rcourtman/pulse:latest
```

Access the dashboard at `http://<your-ip>:7655`.

## 💳 Plans (Community / Pro / Cloud)

Pulse is full-featured for core monitoring in every tier. Paid tiers unlock additional capabilities (and Cloud removes hosting/AI setup friction).

**Community** is free and self-hosted. **Pro** is a paid, self-hosted license. **Cloud** is the hosted plan and includes Pro capabilities.

The table below is derived from the canonical entitlement source of truth: `docs/architecture/ENTITLEMENT_MATRIX.md`.

| Capability | Community | Pro | Cloud |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Pulse Patrol (Background Health Checks) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Alert Analysis | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pulse Patrol Auto-Fix | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Kubernetes Analysis | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Centralized Agent Profiles | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update Alerts (Container/Package Updates) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Basic SSO (OIDC) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Advanced SSO (SAML/Multi-Provider) | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Enterprise Audit Logging | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Advanced Infrastructure Reporting (PDF/CSV) | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| 90-Day Metric History | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Remote Access (Mobile Relay, App Coming Soon) | — | ✅ | ✅ |

Pulse Patrol runs on your schedule (every 10 minutes to every 7 days, default 6 hours) and finds:
- ZFS pools approaching capacity
- Backup jobs that silently failed
- VMs stuck in restart loops
- Clock drift across cluster nodes
- Container health check failures

On self-hosted installs, Pulse Patrol uses your configured provider (BYOK) and runs entirely on your server.

Technical highlights:
- Cross-system context (nodes, VMs, backups, containers, and metrics history)
- LLM analysis with your provider + alert-triggered deep dives (Pro/Cloud)
- Optional auto-fix with command safety policies and audit trail
- Centralized agent profiles for consistent fleet settings
